# Implementing a Job Matrix for Your Engineering Team

Your engineering team has recently grown. Maybe you just secured more funding, maybe your software product just took off. Whatever it is, you are finding it harder and harder to have a big group of people who all have the title “Software Engineer.” You want to add Senior and Principal and Junior. Sound familiar? Here’s what you do.

### Why a job matrix?

First, why would you want to add levels? It all boils down to growth and communication. While some of your engineers might be “career level” and not looking for a promotion, many of them want to grow. A higher level job means higher pay, more interesting work, and a better resume. A clear definition of levels gives employees an understanding of the skills they need to build and demonstrate. It makes performance conversations easier and it facilitates positive relationships between employees.

At one of my previous companies, we had 15-20 engineers who all had the title “software engineer.” This was a problem especially for our more junior engineers. I remember one engineer in particular who had been with us for almost 5 years and had built up an impressive resume of work. However, she had started as a new college grad. First impressions are the ones that stick with us, so people who had been with the company when she started still thought of her as a new college grad, despite the impressive work she was doing. This hamstrung her efforts to bring change and modernization to the codebase. Rolling out levels helped the team recognize the growth she had gone through and encouraged the team to listen to her.

I use this as an example because of the type of people at this company. Each individual was hard-working, kind, growth-oriented, and team-oriented. No one was the type to ignore a junior engineer. But whether we like it or not, there is something in all of us that pays a little more attention when someone of higher “rank” is speaking. So, if you want to support your junior (and mid-level) engineers and recognize their growth, add levels.

Now, how do you do it?

### Step 1: Pick your ladder

What’s the highest level of engineer you have right now? What’s the highest level you are currently hiring for?

It sounds like a silly question since you don’t have levels yet. But if you just hired someone who was previously a “Principal Engineer” that might be your answer. A quick glance at levels.fyi might help here too. Think about this in terms of scope. What is the largest scope of project, technical deep dive, research, or leadership that your company can support in a software engineer? If you are a small web development company, you probably don’t need a “Technical Fellow” and the two-million-dollar yearly compensation that comes with it. But maybe you need someone who can run multi-month projects and set up a database from scratch.

Once you’ve thought of your highest-level engineer (or the highest-level engineer you hope to have), now what’s the lowest level? This will almost always be your new college grad level, but if you have an apprenticeship program or you regularly hire from boot camps, you may have a more junior level that.

Now fill in the rungs between. For the sake of this article, I’m going to assume you chose 5 rungs:

1.	Engineer 1 (sometimes called “associate” or “apprentice” or “junior”)
2.	Engineer 2
3.	Engineer 3
4.	Senior Engineer
5.	Principal Engineer

**Pick a project for each:** Before you get too deep in the weeds, pick a project for each level that exemplifies good performance at that level. For an Engineer 1, think of a task that was recently completed. For Principal Engineer, think of a product. Fill in similar projects representing the scope for each level. This gives you a chance to check your work at each step along the way.

### Step 2: Start sourcing ideas

There are a lot of places you can go to start getting ideas for your job matrix. Here are some of my favorites:

**Existing Job Matrices:** I was at Code.org when our original job matrix was rolled out, and I was one of the maintainers for some years. You can find the engineering version of the matrix on the Code.org GitHub. That one’s based on a few, including the original Rent the Runway matrix. You can also find dozens over at progression.fyi. Some of these even have licenses that let you copy them verbatim.

**Open Roles in the Industry:** These give you an idea of responsibilities at the various levels. If you’re struggling to fill in the “Senior Engineer” matrix, read up on several “Senior Engineer” job descriptions to start getting ideas. The best spot to start is your own open roles since these will be most applicable to you.

**Gen AI:** While by no means should you rely solely on AI, it will help you summarize from across the industry. One tip: don’t start with AI. I found the results in this area to be mediocre while I wanted excellent. It was easier to start with something great but sparse and fill in ideas from the mediocre but verbose output from AI.

### Step 3: Customize to your team’s needs

I was building out a job matrix for AI engineers, which was a new role family for us. As I went, I discovered a huge variety across the job market for what an AI engineer’s responsibilities can be. It reminded me of the importance of tailoring the growth matrix to our own company’s needs. This benefits the company – as someone grows, they can contribute more to the projects valuable to the company – and it benefits the individual – there will always be work available that is aligned to their growth path.

In our case, we needed an AI developer who was more engineer than scientist. They needed to be able to contribute production code and maintain infrastructure in addition to building AI prototypes and training models. I added all this to the matrix, which led to some great growth-oriented conversations.

What do you need in your matrix? Do you need engineers who can talk to customers? Is efficient and performant code important? Do your front-end devs need to be able to do some design work here and there? Here’s a starting list of items you may need in your matrix.

* Bug fixes
* Systems
* Language intricacies
* On-call responsibilities
* Influencing change
* Architecture
* Infrastructure
* Cross team collaboration
* Working with stakeholders

You don’t always need a full ladder for each of these. For example, you may expect the “Engineer 3” in your org to be just as proficient at on-call responsibilities as the “Principal Engineer.” Or, you may have no expectations that engineers think about architecture until they get to “Senior.” That’s healthy. As you start building out the ladders, start grouping responsibilities into categories. This is where you start to get your matrix.

**Remember team work**

I’m hoping you’ve never experienced the horror of a team member who is great at the technical part of their job but is a terrible co-worker. Even worse is if they keep getting promoted despite bringing everybody around them down. Unfortunately, if you’ve been in the workforce for any time, you’ve probably experienced this. Why does this happen? Because teamwork and interpersonal skills are often forgotten on the job matrix. It’s sometimes considered “undefinable” or “intangible.” In reality, it absolutely can be defined.

Start by thinking about a more senior engineer who is a great co-worker. What do they do? Maybe they mentor several other engineers. Maybe they are humble but smart. Maybe they are willing to bend to accommodate other peoples work. Add this to your growth matrix! And ask around too. Ask engineers at all levels what makes someone great to work with. How do you expect people to communicate, leverage the work of others, contribute to the work of others? Should they take responsibility for code reviews, get positive feedback from stakeholders, actively unblock other engineers? Include these too!

We reward what we measure, so make sure you are measuring what you *want* to reward.

### Step 4 Review, Roll out, and Maintain

It’s best to review the matrix with the people who will be affected by it. If nothing else, they can tell you whether it makes sense and is something they could use. Equally as important, once the matrix is live, keep maintaining it. For example, an early matrix while I was at Code.org had a line item that was something like “recognized contributor across the whole codebase.” This made sense when the team was small, but as the codebase and product set grew, this was no longer feasible. We adjusted the language to keep the spirit of the sentiment – having the knowledge and flexibility to contribute meaningfully anywhere – and published an update. The growth matrix should be a living document. Editing it is a healthy process as your team learns and grows.

Now you have your growth matrix. Use it regularly! It will be a great tool for performance conversations, recognition, and will contribute meaningfully to overall team health.

Happy managing!
