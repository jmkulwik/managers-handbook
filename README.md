# The Manager's Handbook

Welcome!

Whether you are wondering how to manage or looking for new ideas for your team, you have come to the right place. I post ideas and learnings regularly about how to be a frontline engineering manager.

Here are my latest articles:

[From "New Boss" to Trusted Leader: Your First 30 Days on the Job](https://github.com/jmkulwik/managers-handbook/blob/main/from-new-boss-to-trusted-leader-your-first-30-days-on-the-job.md)

[Building Trust Through Project Estimates.md](https://github.com/jmkulwik/managers-handbook/blob/main/building-trust-through-project-estimates.md)

Oh, and if you like what you read, you can catch me over at me@jessicakulwik.com where I offer contract management. I specialize in covering leaves of absence so managers can go on Family Medical Leave knowing their team is in good hands.
