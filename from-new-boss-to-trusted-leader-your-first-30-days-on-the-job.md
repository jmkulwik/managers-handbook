# From "New Boss" to Trusted Leader: Your First 30 Days on the Job
You’re managing a new team. Maybe you were just promoted. Maybe you just started a new position. Or, maybe you have been leading your team for a while but things seem just a little off. The first thing you need to do is build trust, but how do you do it? There are three basic steps.

1.	Wait
2.	Listen
3.	Act

Let’s take these one at a time.

### Step 1: Wait

There’s an old adage in management, “Do nothing for your first 30 days.” This doesn’t mean you take a 30 day vacation, instead, you maintain the team’s processes and procedures as close as you can to what they had been before you arrived. And it feels very strange. There are things going wrong on the team that you know how to fix! There’s so much you can contribute from day 1! Trust me, wait. Because that’s ultimately what the first 30 days are about - building trust.

Your team doesn’t know you, and when a person doesn’t know you, they fill in the blanks in their understanding with what they’ve learned from past experiences. And unfortunately, most managers are bad. They aren’t bad people, they just aren’t good at managing yet. So if you take an action that your team doesn’t understand or you deviate from what they are used to, some will assume that you are doing something that will be bad for them, because that’s what happened when a previous manager did something unexpected.

On top of that, there may be a reason things are the way they are. Your team will appreciate you approaching problems with curiosity and humility. Here’s an example: Let’s say the team’s work management system is a mess. You identify this as a problem and replace it right away. Two weeks later, you learn that the old system had been the brainchild of one of the mid-level developers. What could have been an opportunity to coach and grow a member of your team instead eroded trust and made the developer question their performance.

**Lesson 1: Build trust first before you change the status quo.**

### Step 2: Listen

Instead of making changes in the first 30 days, spend that time listening to your team. What does this look like? This is primarily done in 1:1s. A one-on-one is a regular face-to-face meeting between you and a direct report. While it may seem like a huge drain on your and your team’s time, (who needs another 30-minute meeting every week?) it will save time in the end (more on that later).

Your first 1:1s with a team should be spent asking questions. Here are some of my favorites:

* What are some things you like about this team? About the work you do?
* What are some things that get in your way?
* What are some things you hope never change about your job?
* What slows you down?
* How’s the level of collaboration versus siloing?
* What’s frustrating about your work?

These questions are primarily geared toward giving you an idea of the problems that are impacting your team the most from your team’s perspective. More importantly, these questions help you understand the things you shouldn’t change, at least without extreme caution and planning. In addition to these, I also like to ask questions about each member’s goals, motivations, and personal needs, which give me the tools to tailor the particular solution to the particular team.

One final tip: send these questions in advance of your 1:1 meetings. I find I get better answers if people have a chance to think about them ahead of time.

**Lesson 2: Spend time finding out what your team thinks are the biggest problems.**

### Detour: Why hold 1:1s?

Let’s start off with a story. I once worked for a manager who didn’t do 1:1s at all. This manager had an open door policy and encouraged us to interrupt her any time. She was a friendly, approachable person. The only problem? She was extremely busy. Although her door was often open, she’d usually be on a video call or with a client. There were other times she would be out of her office and other times when she’d be in a closed-door meeting. There were many times when I would bring my laptop and sit down the hall waiting for her to come available. On top of that, myself and the other members of the team could tell that she was often stressed. There was a lot of managerial work that we needed her to do, so between that and the stress, we didn’t want to interrupt her focus time. I had many issues I wanted to bring to her attention, but they were rarely important enough to interrupt her.

This meant the only issues I’d bring to her were emergencies. And for most emergencies, I found myself wishing that I had been able to get in sooner, since it was a much smaller problem when I first wanted to bring it up.

1:1s let you catch problems early and address them head-on. But the benefits don’t stop there. They give you regular, positive interactions with each team member – which offsets the occasional cranky day we all have. They help you detect early if a member of your team is considering leaving. They give you a chance to address good and bad performance on a regular basis.

Do you have to do them weekly? It depends on the pace of your company. If you are in a fast-paced, high-stress environment, you need more touch-points with your team. If you are in a slower-paced environment, you can have fewer. In any case, I would start with weekly and adjust as needed.

Now, back to building trust in your first months.

### Step 3: Act

The first change you make should be a win for your team and should address a problem they care about. People generally don’t like change. Why is this? Because change is rarely managed well and even the best change will cause a new (although hopefully smaller) set of problems. Keeping the status quo allows people to build up resiliency in dealing with known problems, while making a change means new patterns need to be learned. That takes time and effort. Despite all that, change is worth it.

After listening to your team, pick one problem that is something most of the team cares about. Preview how you are going to fix it and explain why you are going to fix it. The only thing scarier than change is random, impulsive change. If you don’t explain yourself, your team will make up reasons for your actions based on the little they know about you. Instead, this is a formula I like to use when meeting with my team about a change:

1.	State the problem as you understand it. This should draw directly from feedback from your team.
1.	State the planned solution. Explain why it will address the problem.
1.	Provide some avenue for feedback. Usually in 1:1s.

That third step doesn’t need to be done with all members of your team. I always like to check in with the person who felt the most strongly about the problem and with one of my senior engineers. That gives me a feel for how the message landed. It also gives me a chance to double check that I understood the problem correctly. Your team might have feedback that your solution won’t work or that you should try a different idea. I welcome this type of feedback, but I don’t always change course based on it. Often, I’ll ask that they try my fix for a month and then re-evaluate once we’ve had some experience with it. And I mark the calendar to make sure we do re-visit - waiting for people to forget about their concerns is a cheap trick.

Sometimes, when I get feedback and other ideas, I do shift the plan – usually just by a little bit, sometimes by a lot. It’s the mark of a good leader to admit that you don’t have all the best ideas.

**Lesson 3: Fix a problem your team cares about. But remember, how you communicate about your actions is just as important as the action itself.**

### Why does this process work?

This is just the start, and first impressions matter. You’ve demonstrated positive communication patterns, you’ve spent time listening, and you have solved a real problem that your team really cares about. Keep doing this! Build a pattern of low ego solutions to real problems. Your team will appreciate it. And, when it comes time to fix that big problem you noticed on day 1, not only will your team be much more willing to trust you, but you will also be much more likely to solve it in a way that works well for them.

Happy Managing!
